This is where i can write down some general thoughts and ideas about the build

Ideas:

Issues:
-Ok so the gravity ball got me only so far, which I am coming to realize. The threshold condition within the 
grenade is becoming true at inconvenient times, and is making the logic much harder. I need to take a step 
back and build a more reliable and elegant solution for the "preserved energy" type thing with a ball and 
an object set (wood, stone, metal) which i want to each have a different preserved energy value. 

-We must consider pixel sizes for different computers for when we sell the game. We must find a way to
ensure it is full screen no matter the type of computer you have.

-I am making it too hard on myself by making the ground a different class type rather than a solid block.
The ground should be a block itself, even a really long one, so that the logic for grenade bounces are 
easier to handle. 

-Need to multi-thread the mouse and key events. There is a 'clunkiness' with the controls currently

REMINDERS:
-you have NOT YET replaced the Grenade class used in-game with updated version!!!
